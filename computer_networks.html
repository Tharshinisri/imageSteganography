    <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
    <p>The word "DATA" is fundamental to the realm of modern computing world ,but what is
        so fascinating about it? Present day, Data is the power in the world, and businesses are
        starting to realise that data may be used to predict client trends, enhance revenue, help
        assist the company in reaching greater heights. The technology has improved so much
        that our prime priority is to protect data. Data sharing is expanding in these days as there
        are a lots of data and thousands of messages transmitting every day on the internet from
        one location to a different location. The main concern of the sender is the secure data
        transmission, which is data protection, and it is really important that we communicate
        our message in a way that only the receiver is capable of comprehending.
        In this project, we are going to understand what is Steganography on images and
        how we can implement using python.</p>
    </br>

    <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <h3>Steganography</h3>
    <p> The process of hiding a message(secret message) within a larger one so that the contents
        or presence of the hidden message cannot be known to anyone. This process is called
        Steganography. The primary goal of steganography is to supply intergroup
        communication that is kept secret. Cryptography can only conceals the contents of a
        secret message. But using steganography we can able to conceal the fact that a message
        is communicated. Despite the fact that there are some distinctions, there are numerous
        parallels between cryptography and steganography. Some authors categorize
        steganography as a form of cryptography because hidden communication is a type of
        secret message.
        We can perform steganography on different transmission media like images,video,audio, or
        text.</p>
    </br>

    <h3>TYPES OF STEGANOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p> • Text steganography</p>
    <p> • Image steganography</p>
    <p> • Video steganography</p>
    <p> • Network steganography</p>
    <p> • E-mail steganography</p>
    <p> • Audio steganography</p>
    </br>

    <h3>STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED TO PERFORM IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>• Get the secret message which is to be shared between the sender and receiver</p>
    <p>• Choose an image on which you are going to encode the 
        secret message</p>
    <p>• Encode the secret message into the selected image</p>
    <p>• The sender shares the encoded image which contains the message to the receiver</p>
    <p>• In receiver end, while decoding, the image, the secret message is extracted from the
        image.So, in others point of view it is just an image but to the sender and receiver the secret
        information is successfully shared.</p>
    </br>

    <h3>BASIC STEGANOGRAPHIC MODEL</h3>
    <p>In this basic steganography model, a cover file(image) and a secret message is given to
        the steganographic encoder and the stego object is communicated from sender to the
        receiver through communication channel and steganographic decoder decodes the image
        and the secret message is obtained.</p>

    </br>

    <h3>PROTOCOL FUNCTION UTILIZED BY STEGANOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>The various OSI RM layers that are related to steganography, since it is mainly a data
        transmission between two parties.</p>
    <img src="img/Steg_img2.png">
    </br>

    <h3>OSI RM LAYERS THAT TAKE PART IN IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY</h3>
    <h3>Datalink layer:</h3>
    <p>In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) architecture model for a set of telecommunication
        protocols, layer 2 is the datalink layer. In this layer, data bits were encoded, decoded and
        organized before they are transported. The modified data bits are transported as frames
        between two adjacent nodes on the same WAN or LAN.</p>

    </br>

    <h3>Application layer</h3>
    <p>The layer which specifies the shared communications protocols and the host’s interface
        methods used in a communications network is known as application layer. It is otherwise
        known as abstraction layer. Both the standard models of computer networking, the Internet
        Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model uses the application layer abstraction.</p>

    </br>

    <h3>TOOL USED:</h3>
    <h3>PYTHON</h3>
    <p>• Python is clarified, high level and general-purpose programming language. It was
        created by Guido van
        Rossum and first released in 1991,Python's design philosophy highlights code readability
        in which significant whitespace plays a notable use. It helps programmers to write
        clear,logical code for small and large-scale projects by it's language constructs and object-
        oriented approach. </p>
    <p>• In this project, we implement our concept of image- based steganography using the
        Python programming language. </p>
    <p> • We encode our data and then perform least significant bit (LSB) technique and
        decode our data. Hence, we hide our text messages in image by using PYTHON CODE</p>
    </br>

    <h3>BASIC CONCEPT OF LEAST SIGNIFICANT BIT TECHNIQUE</h3>
    <P>We use significant bit technique to implement our steganography in the image. The data is converted to bits and modification in LSB doesn't affect the data much while MSB does. So, while encoding our secret message changes are made in LSB.</P>

    </br>

    <h3>STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED IN PYTHON:</h3>
    <p>• Import all the required python libraries</p>
    <p>• Define a function to change any type of data into binary bits, to convert the secret data and
        pixel values to binary in the encoding and decoding phase.</p>
    <p>• Write a function to hide secret message into the image by altering the least significant bit
        and another function todecode the hidden message from the stego image • Function that
        takes the input image name and secret message as input from user and calls hideData() to
        encode the message</p>
    <p>• Create a function to ask the user to enter the name of the stegoimage that needs to be
        decoded and call theshowData() function to return the message which was decoded.</p>
    <p>•Main function()</p>
    <p>•Run the program, then see the results</p>

    <h3>MERITS OF NETWORK SECURITY BY IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY USING PYTHON</h3>
    <p>• It provides secured data transmission.</p>
    <p>• Up to now, cryptography plays a vital role in protecting the secret communication between
        the sender and the intended receiver. However, nowadays people uses steganography
        techniques besides cryptography, because it adds more protective layers to the hidden data.
        The advantage of using steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret
        message does not attract attention to itself as an object of scrutiny.</p>
    <p>• It is difficult to detect only the intended receiver can able to detect.</p>
    <p>• If we use large number of softwares, it can be done faster.</p>
    </br>

    <h3>DEMERITS OF NETWORK SECURITY BY IMAGE STEGANOGRAPHY USING
        PYTHON</h3>
    <p>• Steganography is popular among cyber criminals. Recent attacks shows that the attackers used
        Steganography to embed the malicious code inside the file, which is found by security
        researchers that attackers use new malware campaign which uses image to hide the data.</p>
    <p>• Image may become distorted. While compressing image such as JPEG, secret information
        may lost.When steganography is implemented properly, it can be difficult to detect, but not
        impossible.
        </p>
    <p>• Large number of data and large file size which is considered to be disadvantage.</p>
    </br>

    <h3>CONCLUSION AND FUTURE PLANS</h3>
    <p>• Steganography is the nascent stage of development</p>
    <p>• This project provides new method of image steganography ie, using python</p>
    <p>• Our method is general and extended to other LSB based steganographic methods</p>
    <p>• Identifying the maximum capacity of information that can be hidden in an message using a
        particular steganographic tool has to be modeled</p>
    <p>• Postively speaking, steganography has the real potent for the safe transmission of data in this
        hackers world when utilized in a proper manner.</p>
